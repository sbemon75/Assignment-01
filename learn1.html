    <p class="para"> Coding has been changing the world since it was first invented. Back in 1883, the first program language was created. Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were the first individuals who gave numbers a bigger importance than just numerical values. Together they created the Analytical Empire, which is believed to be the first ever primitive mechanical computer. Today there is an estimated total of 700 computer language programs that are used each and every other day.  They paved the way to what coding is today. From our IPhones to even our washing machines, coding is in our everyday lives. Computer programming has been innovating every single industry since the beginning and has changed our everyday lives. From the creation of the internet to cars having satellite cameras, to even helping NASA launch rockets. Computer programming has made the impossible possible. Manual processes that take hours to complete have now been processed instantly thanks to computer processing. Digital assistants, self-driving cars, websites, social medias, smart homes, smart televisions, smart phones even smart toasters have been introduced and made possible thanks to coding. This is just the beginning. Everyday new technologies make our lives more and more simple. Even in the business world data has been processed and used to make important business decisions thanks to computer programming. When the coding world became more and more demanding, and everyday people learned how coding works; more and more people were learning how to computer program. In 1990 there was a total number of 409,700 computer programmers. That number increased to 1,530,100 by 2011. Unfortunately, that trend wasnâ€™t consistent. According to the US bureau of labor statistics, the need for number of computer programmers in the world is expected to grow tremendously over the next decade. This is due to an estimated 10% decrease in the field of computer programmers. With a total headcount of 185,700 computer programmers in 2020, that number is expected to decrease by 18,570 by 2030. The number of computer programmers is only becoming more and more in demand. This is concerning because coding is a big part of our lives. With technology improving every day we need coders to improve with them. In a society where innovation is happening every day, and new inventions are needed in everyday lives there will always be a demand for computer programmers. Imagine the impact the world would feel if there was a shortage in computer programming?
