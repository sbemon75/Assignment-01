            <p>HTML is a markup coding language. It sorts through data thatâ€™s been categorized with HTML tags, making it possible to define it and describe its purpose on a web page. HTML tells a web browser essentially what different page elements are and where they should go when loading the page.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I find inspiration for my web designs in many places. I often look to other designers and web developers for inspiration and ideas. I also like to look at the latest trends in web design, such as responsive design, minimalism, and user-centered design. Additionally, I often draw inspiration from the content and goals of the website I am designing, as well as the target audience. Finally, I also try to draw inspiration from my own creativity and experience to come up with unique and innovative designs.
